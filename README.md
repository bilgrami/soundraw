# AI Music Generation via soundraw
Generate music based on metadata using Soundraw's API and this Bash script. 
It processes a CSV file containing music metadata, sends API requests to Soundraw, and downloads the generated music files in .m4a format.

Special thanks for soundraw.io team for making such a great and easy to use API.

For more information, refer to the Soundraw API documentation:

- [POWERFUL AI MUSIC TOOL FOR DEVELOPERS](https://discover.soundraw.io/api)
- [API doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/185WjC7T1Rq1-9zKlARobmeFiR3VaJcN1IT4ZwDP03Tg/edit#heading=h.3pt5vjbx3xdc)

## Prerequisites
- Bash shell
- jq (JSON processor)
- curl (HTTP client)
- AWK (text processing tool)
- shuf (random number generator)

Ensure these tools are installed and configured on your system.

**Installation of jq on Windows:**
```sh
curl -L -o /usr/bin/jq.exe https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/latest/download/jq-win64.exe
```


## Configuration

### .secret File
Create a .secret file in your project directory with the following content. Ensure this file is secure and not accessible publicly.
```
export URL=https://soundraw.io/api/v2/musics/compose
export AUTH_TOKEN='your_soundraw_auth_token'
```

Replace 'your_soundraw_auth_token' with your actual Soundraw auth token.

### generate.sh File

Optionally, you can Configure the default values of the following parameters within the generate.sh file:

- param_file_name: Name of the CSV file containing input parameters (default: soundraw_params.csv)
- num_batches: Number of songs generated per line in the input file (default: 2)
- length: Duration of the generated music in seconds (default: 300)


### Example of soundraw_params.csv

```csv
mood,genres,themes,tempo,tempo_2,energy_levels
Peaceful,Rock,Wedding & Romance,low,,Medium
Elegant,Lofi Hip Hop,Wedding & Romance,normal,normal,Medium
```

## Usage

### Running the Script with Custom Parameters

bash
```
chmod +x generate.sh
./generate.sh custom_soundraw_params 5 30
```

### Running the Script with Default Values

```bash
chmod +x generate.sh
./generate.sh

```

## Sample Music output 

### Listen to the Music file

<audio controls>
    <source src="https://soundraw-api-storage.com/final_c575a1b1-3e1b-4f8e-bbad-65e30b71fd97.m4a" type="audio/m4a">
    Your browser does not support the audio element. 
</audio>

### Download the Music file

[Download the music file](https://soundraw-api-storage.com/final_c575a1b1-3e1b-4f8e-bbad-65e30b71fd97.m4a)

## Script Flow
- Extract music metadata from CSV file.
- Generate a unique output file name.
- Prepare JSON payload for the API request.
- Send POST request to Soundraw's API.
- Download music file if m4a_url is present in the response.
- Save API response and request parameters to a JSON file.
- Exit script if m4a_url is not present, handling errors appropriately.

## Cleanup
Check the output directories (output/$today/music, output/$today/response, output/$today/temp) for downloaded music files, API responses, and temporary files. Manage sensitive data securely.

## Notes
- Ensure the input CSV file and .secret file are correctly formatted and located.
- The API is expected to return a JSON response containing the m4a_url field.
